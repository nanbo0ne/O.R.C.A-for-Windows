# O.R.C.A. 3.0.10

**O.R.C.A.** (**Open Reasoning & Computing Agent**) is an open-source workspace for real work. It brings model conversations, Assistant, Coding, research, files and images, engineering tools, memory, and automation into one pausable, inspectable, recoverable application.

> **3.0.10** fixes effort persistence and request behavior, keeps Stop available throughout a running turn, and preserves both new drafts and cancelled drafts when Submit resolves later. Stop failures retain running state, and stale completions cannot stop the next turn. The standard Windows installer and Modern / Classic layouts are retained.

## Three Work Modes

| Mode | Best for | Default boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ORCA Agent** | Cross-session coordination, bot channels, and a persistent entry point | Owns dispatch, waiting, and automation; it is not a replacement for ordinary text subagents |
| **Assistant** | Questions, research, writing, information organization, office files, and everyday work | Uses web/local tools, Assistant memory, plans, automation, and artifact tools |
| **Coding** | Repository development, debugging, refactoring, testing, and review | Uses Shell, files, Git, LSP, CodeGraph, checkpoints, and engineering verification |

Modes are stored per session. Switching preserves visible history and rebuilds the prompt, tool, and memory boundary for the target mode after the active turn finishes or stops. Orca is the fixed top-level control entry; ordinary sessions still choose Assistant or Coding.

## Features

### Providers, Models, and Roles

- First run asks for a DeepSeek key, validation, or skip. New installations default to `deepseek/deepseek-flash` (DeepSeek V4.1 Flash); ordinary subagents inherit the main model unless configured separately. Adding a provider offers DeepSeek or custom OpenAI-compatible/Anthropic-compatible access. Existing providers, separate keys, and custom roles remain. Older official DeepSeek choices retain the migration introduced in 3.0.5; 3.0.10 does not repeat completed migration.
- Provider IDs, base URLs, credential slots, and fully qualified `provider/model` references are isolated. Same-name models do not silently cross-resolve to another endpoint.
- Provider corrections from 3.0.6/3.0.7 remain: the displayed protocol matches the saved value, backend Agent endpoints are normalized, and protocol/endpoint mismatches give actionable guidance to check the protocol and Base URL without switching credentials to another provider. These are not new protocol fixes in 3.0.10.
- The main conversation, planner, subagent, and Orca/automation roles can be selected independently. Computer Use role configuration is retained but does not run in this version. A role is not a guarantee of model capability: context, pricing, tool calling, and vision still depend on the actual model and its checks.
- **Official models:** `deepseek/deepseek-flash` is the canonical reference for DeepSeek V4.1 Flash: native vision, a 1M-token context, up to 384K output tokens, tool calls, and JSON Output. The old `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` names are compatibility aliases routed by the official service to V4.1 Flash, not separate models. `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` remains selectable and text-only, without image support.
- **Vision role:** explicit configuration takes precedence, followed by the confirmed vision-capable current model and then the official `deepseek/deepseek-flash` default candidate. Sending still checks the target provider and image permissions; images never silently cross providers, and explicitly disabling vision stays effective. Flash vision capability does not automatically give subagents images or upload permission.
- **3.0.5 migration compatibility:** upgrades from older versions retain the previously introduced one-time migration of official DeepSeek defaults, model roles, and saved session selections to V4.1 Flash, including old official Pro choices. 3.0.10 does not repeat completed migration, and deliberate Pro selections made afterward remain. Custom providers, proxy endpoints, separate credentials, and non-official model choices stay isolated. Matching model names alone never trigger cross-provider migration; historical messages and stored amounts are not rewritten.
- **Reasoning effort:** official DeepSeek supports `low` / `high` / `max`, with `auto` resolving to `high`. The thinking toggle and effort are separate; Compact/Detailed only changes reasoning visibility. Missing credentials or failed capability checks should produce a visible reason and a configuration path, not a false success.
- When pricing, balance, or context metadata is unreliable, the UI hides it or marks it unknown instead of displaying a misleading zero. Provider data retention, billing, and training policies remain provider-specific.

DeepSeek models and pricing were checked against the [official pricing page](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/zh-cn/quick_start/pricing/), [updates](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/zh-cn/updates), and [thinking-mode guide](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/zh-cn/guides/thinking_mode/) on 2026-09-17. Prices below are CNY per million tokens:

| Model and period | Cache-hit input | Cache-miss input | Output |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| V4.1 Flash off-peak (including aliases) | ¥0.02 | ¥1 | ¥4 |
| V4.1 Flash peak (including aliases) | ¥0.04 | ¥2 | ¥8 |
| Pro off-peak | ¥0.15 | ¥4.5 | ¥13.5 |
| Pro peak | ¥0.30 | ¥9 | ¥27 |

Peak periods are fixed at Monday-Friday 09:00-12:00 and 14:00-18:00 in UTC+8. Other times, including weekends, are off-peak. Each request freezes its pricing basis at start; historical amounts are not recalculated. Amounts already stored for 3.0.3 remain USD and are not back-converted to RMB. A session containing USD and CNY turns is not shown as one authoritative total; each turn keeps its own currency.

### Workspaces, Sessions, and Context

- Project workspaces bind to real directories; independent workspaces cover tasks that do not need a repository. Each session has boundaries for history, attachments, workspace references, and tool cwd.
- Multiple tabs, pinning, renaming, branch/fork operations, history, recycle bin, export, and resume are supported. Checkpoints, rollback, and rewind restore related state only when its scope is known; they cannot undo side effects in external systems.
- Long sessions can compact context, preserve compaction archives, and search older local sessions. Compaction is not a complete backup; write important facts to project files or explicit memory.
- Turns, items, tool results, and final answers are stored separately. Successful turns may fold; failed, cancelled, interrupted, and denied turns retain diagnostics.
- Background work, model loading, downloads, and approvals have separate states. Starting a background subagent does not mean the current work is complete; dependent work must wait and inspect its result.

### Images, Files, and Artifacts

- Paste, drop, or reference PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, and common document, spreadsheet, presentation, and text formats. In-workspace files can be referenced in place; out-of-workspace files are copied into the current workspace attachment area.
- Images are current-turn input by default and are not written into session JSONL, titles, memory, or compaction text. They are still sent to the enabled vision provider. Size, count, format, and model capability limit availability.
- The main agent may delegate images generated in its current workspace. After file-read and image-send permission checks, the app validates paths, formats, and limits and saves an immutable attachment snapshot. Being inside the workspace is not upload permission. Cross-session files, directory escapes, and link replacement are rejected.
- For example, attach an image you choose and ask, "Extract the table in this image as CSV," or attach a document for a summary. Disabling Computer Use does not affect ordinary attachment processing; the app does not capture the screen for these tasks.
- `artifact_create`, `artifact_edit`, `artifact_preview`, and `artifact_validate` cover DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and PDF. Artifacts carry a structured sidecar for follow-up edits and integrity checks.
- Real previews require a local renderer. Missing dependencies produce an explicit error rather than a placeholder image. Structural validation is not a guarantee of layout, fonts, formulas, pagination, or every page. Complex third-party Office files may be refused for editing; the original is not overwritten.

### Tools, Engineering, and Subagents

- Tools include file operations, search, Shell, Git, tests, builds, package managers, and browser/network capabilities as enabled by the tool library and provider configuration. Tool groups can be disabled.
- Coding mode emphasizes LSP, CodeGraph, code review, security checks, Plan, Todo, Goal, checkpoints, and verification after writes. Tool output is evidence, not an automatic test-pass claim.
- Subagents run focused research, analysis, vision, or engineering work in separate sessions and return a final result to the parent. Saved subagent transcripts can be waited on, continued, or forked when their tool scope, model, effort, workspace, and parent session match.
- Subagent/Skill meta-tools do not recurse without bound. Keep references and failure reasons, and never turn “started” into “completed.”

### MCP, Skills, Bots, and Automation

- MCP supports stdio and Streamable HTTP. The manager shows servers, authorization, connection state, failures, retries, and exposed tools. Keep secrets in environment variables or local credentials, not project files.
- Skills are discovered as `SKILL.md` or named Markdown playbooks from built-in, global, project, or custom roots. The slash menu exposes commands, Skills, and MCP prompts. Disabling a Skill hides it from prompts and invocation without deleting its files.
- Orca can list, read, dispatch, wait for, inspect, or stop ordinary session tasks; it does not recursively dispatch itself. QQ, Weixin, Feishu, and other bot channels depend on their account, configuration, and network.
- Bot, automation, and personal-profile data use explicit configuration and isolated workspaces. Continuous monitoring or scheduled work keeps approval, failure, and notification boundaries; a chat does not silently create an ordinary sidebar session.

### Local AI

3.0.10 keeps O.R.C.A.-managed `llama.cpp` and model downloads temporarily disabled on every platform. Pages, onboarding routes, and startup switches are hidden. Backend installation, download, resume, and automatic startup are also blocked. Stop, cancel, and cleanup interfaces remain; existing files and configuration are not automatically deleted.

External OpenAI-compatible local services may still be configured manually. The app does not take over LM Studio. Hardware detection, download, and loading implementations are retained for later independent acceptance.

### Computer Use: Temporarily Disabled

3.0.10 keeps Computer Use disabled on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**. It registers no computer-control tools, captures no screens, and performs no native mouse, keyboard, or window-control actions. ORCA Agent, automation, bots, and subtasks cannot start this feature.

Its code and configuration remain for restoration after validation in a later version. Existing consent, Full access, and control-model settings cannot enable it in this release. Default Vision, images you explicitly provide, and ordinary file attachments remain supported. Ask the assistant to analyze attachments or organize files; desktop operation is unavailable.

Earlier native test records remain part of the acceptance requirements for restoring the feature. See the validation record for details.

### Permissions and Privacy

- Ask, automatic review, and Full access are distinct strategies. Host deny rules, workspace write boundaries, network proxy, and tool-library switches take precedence over model requests.
- Automatic review can use a separate classification request without full history, tool output, images, or secrets. Classifier failures follow the current approval policy's fallback and record a warning; host deny and explicit ask rules remain authoritative.
- API keys stay in local credentials/environment variables. They are not written into chat messages, titles, memory, release packages, or this repository. Check each provider's retention, training, region, and billing policies before connecting it.
- Sessions, configuration, credentials, attachments, cache, logs, memory, local models, and download tasks are stored separately for backup and cleanup. Sharing, bots, and MCP servers may send data to additional third-party endpoints.

### Modern and Classic

- Running tool groups and stage replies appear in their actual order; received text fragments render incrementally. Compact/Detailed labels are retained. Compact hides provider reasoning by default and Detailed shows it; both show progress and tools, without changing model reasoning effort.
- **3.0.8 navigation and width:** the Modern turn rail centers vertically around its contents and grows to 240px before scrolling internally. The Composer and queue/approval areas are centered with an 884px maximum width; the transcript scroll viewport still fills the chat pane. Fix narrow approval-area height and the position offset caused by restored-history entrance animation.
- **3.0.8 bottom controls:** access stays on the left, running status occupies its own middle track, and the right side orders effort, model, pause/resume, and send/stop. Lighter selectors keep the controls on one row in narrow Composers. Modern always shows effort; unknown capability displays "Model default" with a provider-settings entry, without inventing supported levels. Model and effort menus support arrow keys, Home/End, and focus restoration on close.
- Tool-summary merging from 3.0.6/3.0.7 continues to retain actual stage text and order, without generic replacements or lost intermediate replies. 3.0.10 does not reimplement that logic or change the Classic layout and control arrangement.
- Completed process details fold into a light bordered header with state, elapsed time, turn tokens, and verifiable official DeepSeek cost. The final answer stays outside. Request-deduplicated totals include associated subagents and risk review; unknown, unsettled, or missing-usage costs stay hidden. Reasoning is not added to output tokens twice.
- Turn navigation sits at the left chat edge. Todo is a small independent floating control above the Composer, with transparent, non-intercepting sides. The fixed conversation is labeled ORCA Agent; its history and ID stay unchanged.
- **Modern** is the default lightweight interface with compact menus, a timeline, a single-row Composer, model/effort controls, and responsive layout.
- **Classic** retains the V2.1.3 blue-and-white layout, native window decoration, and control arrangement while using the V3 session, provider, tool, and permission services.
- The style choice is persisted. Windows Modern owns its title bar; Classic uses the native frame and normally needs a restart to switch the shell fully.

## Platform Limits

| Capability | Windows | macOS | Linux |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Cloud providers, sessions, Assistant/Coding/Orca, files, MCP, Skills, memory | Available | Available | Available |
| Managed `llama.cpp` / model downloads | Temporarily disabled | Temporarily disabled | Temporarily disabled |
| Computer Use | Temporarily disabled | Temporarily disabled | Temporarily disabled |
| Modern / Classic | Both shells | Native platform window | Native platform window |

Windows requires WebView2; macOS uses system WebKit; Linux requires GTK/WebKitGTK runtime libraries. Distribution and GPU-driver differences can cause blank windows, flicker, or font problems. Platform packages and native installation remain subject to the validation record.

## Install and Update

### Install

1. On Windows, choose the x64 installer from the Release page. Back up user data before upgrading; extract the portable ZIP to a user-writable directory. Configure a provider on first run or skip setup; no API key is bundled.
2. On macOS, open the Universal DMG and drag the app to Applications. If signing or notarization status requires Gatekeeper confirmation, follow the system prompt; do not download an untrusted bypass script.
3. On Linux, install the DEB after preparing matching WebKitGTK/GTK dependencies. Use the system package manager or a source build when the distribution lacks the required library.
4. Compare the package with the signature, SHA-256, and manifest from the Release page.

Windows publisher-signing and macOS notarization limitations continue: Windows packages lack Authenticode publisher signing, and macOS packages are not notarized. Minisign verifies update integrity; it is not operating-system publisher certification.

### In-App Updates

- The stable channel first checks [`https://orca.aichat.diy/updates/stable/latest.json`](https://orca.aichat.diy/updates/stable/latest.json). If it fails, it falls back to GitHub's signed manifest and matching signed payload. Manifest, payload, version, and SHA-256 must agree; a failed signature must never be installed.
- An installed Windows build offers **explicit download -> user confirms exit -> run the installer**. It never downloads or installs in the background. The app should save sessions and drafts before exit and leave the existing installation in place if the operation fails.
- Downloads show source, measured speed, and estimated time remaining. Sustained low speed suggests another source: cancel, select, and retry to resume a valid partial file. The alternative must match the signed version, size, and digest; switching never relaxes verification. Throughput depends on the network and server, and GitHub is not guaranteed to be faster.
- macOS/Linux show the available version and integrity details and open the matching download page/package. Cross-platform in-place updating is not presented as complete. The macOS check uses the URL above as its primary source, with GitHub as fallback.
- Older versions without a working in-app update path need one manual installation from a published Release page. Do not edit the config version or replace credential files by hand to force an upgrade. 3.0.10 uses native Go detection and a new draft/session-saving shutdown channel, and still prevents skipped installation files. Forced termination of an unresponsive older version cannot guarantee preservation of unsaved content; save tasks before manual upgrades. Upgrade and data-retention test results are listed in the release verification record.

## Configuration and Migration

- Current project configuration is `orca.toml`; project state is `.orca/`; project instructions are `ORCA.md`; environment variables use the `ORCA_` prefix. Legacy V2 paths and environment variables remain readable for migration; new content uses the names above.
- User configuration is normally `os.UserConfigDir()/orca/config.toml`; the same root holds `credentials`, `sessions`, `archive`, `cache`, and memory data. On Windows this resolves through the system `AppData`, commonly `%APPDATA%\\orca\\`. Local models and runtimes use a separate local data root; use Settings for the actual path.
- Configuration merges in priority order: explicit flags/parameters, project `orca.toml`, user configuration, and built-in defaults. Project `.mcp.json` can also provide MCP. Workspaces resolve their own config, `.env`, MCP, and sessions.
- Before migration, close the app and back up the `orca` and legacy V2 user roots, plus project config, `.orca/`, attachments, and instruction files. Migration should preserve sessions, attachments, provider references, credentials references, memory, Skills, MCP, bots, and telemetry; keep the old root as rollback material.
- Migration cannot undo external side effects or infer one provider's key for another. 3.0.10 introduces no new official DeepSeek migration and does not repeat the completed 3.0.5 migration; custom role/model settings and deliberate post-upgrade selections are preserved. Computer Use code and configuration remain; migration does not re-enable the feature. On failure, fall back to compatibility reads and the backup; do not delete the source files.

## Build From Source

You need Go, Node.js, npm, and Wails CLI v2. Linux also needs GTK/WebKitGTK; building the Windows installer needs NSIS. The desktop module has its own dependencies and frontend build:

```powershell
cd desktop\frontend
npm install
npm run build

cd ..\..
go test ./...
cd desktop
go test .
wails build
```

Run `wails dev` in `desktop` for development. Running `npm run dev` alone uses a browser mock and cannot prove Wails bindings, native file drops, window framing, local AI, or Computer Use. Release builds use the official version and validated frontend artifacts and signatures.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check first |
| --- | --- |
| No model or request failure | Provider access, complete `provider/model`, local credentials, and proxy reachability; for vision, check the model capability result |
| Custom-provider protocol or endpoint mismatch | Check the actual OpenAI-compatible / Anthropic-compatible selection, saved value, and Base URL against the configuration error; do not transfer the same key to a different provider |
| Image rejected | Format/size/count, vision mode, current role, and model capability; text subagents do not gain vision automatically |
| Artifact generated but preview fails | Renderer dependency or unverified layout; structural validation is not visual acceptance; check Poppler and the target Office reader |
| Tool blocked | Ask/Auto/Full access, deny rules, workspace path, sandbox, and tool-library switches; do not disable security boundaries to resolve an unknown error |
| Local AI is missing | Managed runtime and downloads remain temporarily disabled in 3.0.10; old configuration cannot enable them. Files remain and custom external services still work |
| Computer Use is missing or requests are refused | It remains temporarily disabled; consent or model settings cannot enable it. Ordinary Vision image analysis and file attachments remain supported |
| Blank window or frame issue | WebView2/WebKitGTK/GTK versions, GPU driver, and Modern/Classic selection; restart and collect logs before classifying it as a native defect |
| Updater does nothing | Primary manifest, GitHub fallback, signature/version fields, and system proxy; on Windows manually download and exit to install rather than expecting a background install |
